Currently, I am contributing to a cutting-edge Chinese crypto exchange, where I work on building innovative software solutions for the crypto space. My role revolves around creating secure, scalable, and efficient systems that empower users and drive the future of cryptocurrency.

I also have a passion for education, which I express as a Front-End Lecturer at Mziuri Programming School, where I teach the next generation of developers. Previously, I lectured on Algorithmics at Global, covering Python and JavaScript. My career also includes roles as a Front-End Developer at Zolobet Casino, a React Developer at Own Foundation, a Back-End Developer Lecturer at Educity, and a Back-End Developer at Doer. Each experience has strengthened my understanding of both development and teaching, enabling me to inspire others while continuing to grow in my own career.
