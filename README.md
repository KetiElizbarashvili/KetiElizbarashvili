Currently, I am contributing to a cutting-edge Chinese crypto exchange, where I work on building innovative software solutions for the crypto space. My role revolves around creating secure, scalable, and efficient systems that empower users and drive the future of cryptocurrency.

In addition, I serve as a Software Developer at Bitasmbl, an AI-powered platform dedicated to helping junior developers bridge the gap between theory and real-world experience. We provide personalized AI assistance, enabling emerging talent to gain hands-on experience and elevate their skills in a supportive, practical environment.

I also have a passion for education, which I express as a Front-End Lecturer at Mziuri Programming School, where I teach the next generation of developers. Previously, I lectured on Algorithmics at Global, covering Python and JavaScript. My career also includes roles as a Front-End Developer at Zolobet Casino, a React Developer at Own Foundation, a Back-End Developer Lecturer at Educity, and a Back-End Developer at Doer. Each experience has strengthened my understanding of both development and teaching, enabling me to inspire others while continuing to grow in my own career.
