Part of the [**Meama-DEV**](https://github.com/Meama-DEV) projects.

I now serve as an Software Developer at Meama, developing intelligent solutions that bridge the gap between innovation and real-world applications, and as a Software Engineer at Blackbox, where I build innovative software solutions.
I previously contributed to a cutting-edge Chinese crypto exchange, where I built secure, scalable, and efficient systems that empowered users and drove the future of cryptocurrency.

My passion for education shines through my role as a Front-End Lecturer at Mziuri Programming School, where I teach the next generation of developers. Previously, I lectured at Algorithmics Global, covering Python and JavaScript. My career also includes roles as a Front-End Developer at Zolobet Casino, a React Developer at Own Foundation, a Back-End Developer Lecturer at Educity, and a Back-End Developer at Doer. Each experience has strengthened my expertise in development and teaching, enabling me to inspire others while continuing to grow in my own career.
